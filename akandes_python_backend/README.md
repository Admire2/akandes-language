# AkandeChips Python Backend

This folder is intended for the Python Language Server backend that will be used by the AkandeChips VS Code extension.

## Getting Started
- Set up your Python environment (a virtual environment is recommended).
- Implement the Language Server Protocol (LSP) using a library such as `pygls` or `python-lsp-server`.
- Ensure the server can be started from the extension (e.g., via a script or entry point).

## Example Libraries
- [pygls](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls)
- [python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server)

## Development
- The extension will launch this backend as a subprocess.
- Communicate using stdio or TCP as required by the LSP.
