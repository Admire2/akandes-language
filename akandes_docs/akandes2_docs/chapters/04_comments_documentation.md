## What is HDL?
HDL stands for Hardware Description Language. It is used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits.

## Getting Started
To begin with HDL, you will need:
- A text editor
- An HDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado)
- Basic knowledge of digital logic design

## Basic Syntax
Here are some basic syntax rules for writing HDL:
- Comments: Use `--` for single-line comments.
- Entity and Architecture: Define your design using entities and architectures.

### Example
```vhdl
entity AND_Gate is
    Port ( A : in  STD_LOGIC;
           B : in  STD_LOGIC;
           Y : out STD_LOGIC);
end AND_Gate;

architecture Behavioral of AND_Gate is
begin
    Y <= A and B;
end Behavioral;
```

## Example Projects
- **Project 1**: Simple AND Gate
- **Project 2**: 4-bit Adder
