## Introduction
Welcome to the HDL Courses Beginners Tutorial! This guide is designed to help you get started with Hardware Description Languages, focusing on the fundamental concepts and practical applications.

## What is HDL?
HDL stands for Hardware Description Language. It is a specialized language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits. Common HDLs include VHDL and Verilog.

## Getting Started
To begin your journey with HDL, you will need:
- A computer with a suitable operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- An HDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado, or GHDL)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)

## Basic Syntax
### VHDL Syntax
- Entity Declaration
- Architecture Body
- Signal Declaration

### Verilog Syntax
- Module Declaration
- Input/Output Declaration
- Always Blocks

## Creating Your First HDL Program
### Example in VHDL
```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity hello_world is
end hello_world;

architecture Behavioral of hello_world is
begin
    process
    begin
        report "Hello, World!";
        wait;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

### Example in Verilog
```verilog
module hello_world;
    initial begin
        $display("Hello, World!");
    end
endmodule
```

## Simulation and Testing
