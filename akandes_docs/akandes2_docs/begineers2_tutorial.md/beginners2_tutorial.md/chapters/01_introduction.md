## What is HDL & Akandes?

### Topic Explanation (1 page)

**Hardware Description Language (HDL)** is a specialized language for describing the structure and behavior of digital circuits. The two most popular HDLs are **VHDL** and **Verilog**.

**Akandes Language** is a modern, AI-assisted HDL designed for adaptive semiconductor and AI-driven chip design. It features clean syntax, modular design, and can compile to Verilog, VHDL, and more.

**Why use HDL & Akandes?**
- Rapid prototyping, simulation, and debugging of digital designs.
- AI-driven code generation and optimization (AkandeAI).
- Modern syntax and educational focus (Akandes).
- Compiles to industry-standard HDLs for hardware implementation.

**Example: 2-bit Comparator**

*Akandes:*
```akandes
module COMPARE2 {
    input x[1:0], y[1:0];
    output gt = x > y;
    output eq = x == y;
    output lt = x < y;
}
```
*Verilog:*
```verilog
module compare2(input [1:0] x, input [1:0] y, output gt, output eq, output lt);
    assign gt = x > y;
    assign eq = x == y;
    assign lt = x < y;
endmodule
```
