## 🧠 What Is Akandes Language?

**Akandes Language** is a **front-end hardware description language (HDL)** designed specifically for **modern semiconductor development** — particularly adaptive, runtime-reconfigurable, mesh-connected system-on-chip (SoC) architectures.

It is the **future language of the semiconductor industry**, engineered for both professionals and beginners involved in chip design, architectural modeling, and AI-driven logic acceleration.

### 🔁 Backend-Agnostic Compilation

Akandes Language does **not replace Verilog or VHDL** — it compiles **into them**.  
This makes Akandes the **developer-facing language** while treating legacy HDLs as **backend targets**.

Future backend support will include:
- ✅ Verilog and VHDL (active)
- 🔜 SystemVerilog, Chisel, FIRRTL
- 🔁 Custom IR for simulator integration

Akandes is designed to be the **language learners start with**, while toolchains translate into backend formats for synthesis, simulation, and deployment.

### 💡 Embedded Intelligence: AkandeAI

**AkandeAI** is an embedded artificial intelligence engine integrated directly into the Akandes compiler and language platform. It provides:

- 🧠 AI-driven code generation for both programmers and non-programmers
- 💅 Automatic formatting, suggestions, and optimization
- 🌐 On-demand code fetching of libraries, apps, and modules — even if outside Akandes Language
- 🔁 Integration into PASE (Plugin-Aware Scripting Extension) for scripting, logic assistance, and automation

AkandeAI acts like a real-time co-architect: helping users synthesize modules, format code, retrieve tools, and adapt across domains.

### 🧩 Vision for the Future

Akandes Language will serve as:
- 🚀 The universal **front-end DSL for semiconductor design**
- 🧵 The bridge between software, hardware, and AI engineering
- 🧠 A platform for learning and prototyping with adaptive and intelligent silicon workflows

Whether you’re building a reconfigurable AI accelerator or orchestrating mesh NoCs, Akandes Language brings clarity, adaptability, and intelligence to your HDL journey.

# AkandeChips VS Code Extension

This is a VS Code extension scaffolded with Yeoman and Generator-Code. It is intended to provide language support and connect to a Python backend (LSP).

## Features

- Language support for AkandeChips Programming Language
- Connects to a Python Language Server backend

## Getting Started

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Press `F5` to launch the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

## Development

- The extension is written in TypeScript.
- The backend Language Server should be implemented in Python and started by the extension.

## Resources

- [VS Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)
- [VS Code Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
